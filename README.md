## What is this?

A recent hot topic among academics in computer science is the study of chemical reaction networks (CRNs).
These chemical processes can mimic certain computational processes, including, under certain circumstances, Turing Machines.<sup>[1]</sup>

The reactions that compose a CRN can be modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs)<sup>[2]</sup>.
This project takes in a CRN and spits out the corresponding ODEs, based on the process described in Hárs's and Tóth's paper.

## Who was involved?

Charlie Labuzzetta, Nyle Sutton, and I collaborated on this project as a research project for Iowa State's [Laboratory for Molecular Programming](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~lamp/).
Much thanks is due to our mentor, Dr. Jack Lutz as well as the other members of the LAMP group.

Charlie and Nyle later presented this work at the [Stukpa Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://stupka.las.iastate.edu/).
