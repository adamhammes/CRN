\begin{frame}{Proof of Theorem - Reverse Direction}
    
	For a system of differential equations of the form \(\dot x = p - xq\) there exists a unique "canonic mechanism" which can be algorithmically derived from the differential equations.\newline
        
  	For each differential equation, each chemical complex belonging to the products \(p\) of form \(\phi_{\rho}(x) \prod_{y \in \Lambda} [y]^{\textbf{r}_{\rho}(y)}\) is increased by \(\dot x\) at rate \(\phi_{p(x)}\). Each of the chemical complexes belonging to the reactants \(r\), uneffected by negative cross effects and of form \(x\phi_{\rho}(x) \prod_{y \in \Lambda} [y]^{\textbf{r}_{\rho}(y)}\) is decreased by \(\dot x\) at rate \(\phi_{p(x)}\).\newline
        
        %product equation before: \(\phi_{p(x)}\textbf{p}_{y \in \Lambda}^{\textbf{r}_{p(y)}}\) 
      	%reactant equation before: \(x\phi_{p(x)}q_{y \in \Lambda}^{\textbf{r}_{p(y)}}\)
        
        Thus we can form the reactions:\newline \newline
        \(p_{y \in \Lambda}^{\textbf{r}_{p(y)}} \to p_{y \in \Lambda}^{\textbf{r}_{p(y)}} + \dot x\) \newline \newline
        \(xq_{y \in \Lambda}^{\textbf{r}_{p(y)}} \to xq_{y \in \Lambda}^{\textbf{r}_{p(y)}} - \dot x\)
