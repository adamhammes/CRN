\begin{frame}{Proof of Theorem - Reverse Direction}
    
		For a system of differential equations of the form \(\dot x = p - xq\) there exists a unique "canonic mechanism" which can be algorithmically derived from the differential equations.\newline
        
        For each differential equation, we have the sum of the products \(p_{y \in \Lambda}^{\underaccent{\tilde}{r}_{p(y)}}\) increased by \(\dot x\) at rate \(\phi_{p(x)}\), and the sum of the reactants, uneffected by negative cross effects, \(xq_{y \in \Lambda}^{\underaccent{\tilde}{r}_{p(y)}}\) decreased by \(\dot x\) at rate \(\phi_{p(x)}\).\newline
        
        Thus we can form the reactions:\newline \newline
        \(p_{y \in \Lambda}^{\underaccent{\tilde}{r}_{p(y)}} \to p_{y \in \Lambda}^{\underaccent{\tilde}{r}_{p(y)}} + \dot x\) \newline \newline
        \(xq_{y \in \Lambda}^{\underaccent{\tilde}{r}_{p(y)}} \to xq_{y \in \Lambda}^{\underaccent{\tilde}{r}_{p(y)}} - \dot x\)
