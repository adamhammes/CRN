\begin{frame}{Theorem}
\begin{center}
A mass-action CRN can be behaviorally represented by a system of differential
equations in which $\forall x \in \Lambda$, the behavior equation for $x$ is
precisely of the form $\dot{[x]} = p - [x]q$, where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials
of the species concentrations with nonnegative, real coefficients.
